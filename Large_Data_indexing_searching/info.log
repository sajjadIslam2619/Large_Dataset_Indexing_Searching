At that\ntime I was a graduate student in theoretical physics already\nwithin sight of the end of my dissertation.  A fortunate involvement\nwith an experimental college course treating physical\nscience for the non-scientist provided my first exposure to\nout-of-date scientific theory and practice radically undermined\nsome of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and\nthe reasons for its special success.\n  Those conceptions were ones I had previously drawn partly\nfrom scientific training itself and partly from a long-standing\navocational interest in the philosophy of science.  Somehow,\nwhatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility,\nthose notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study\ndisplayed.  Yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions\nof science, and their failures of verisimilitude therefore\nseemed thoroughly worth pursuing.  The result was a drastic\nshift in my career plans, a shift from physics to history of\nscience and then, gradually, from relatively straightforward\nhistorical problems back to the more philosophical concerns that\nhad initially led me to history.  Except for a few articles, this\nessay is the first of my published works in which these early\nconcerns are dominant.

Two aspects to be considered in designing a storage\nsystem are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and the \ncriteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This study\ndemonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storage \nquantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the\nsmall shelving costs associated with stored materials..\n   Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and the\nother utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared..\nFor the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost critical\nage at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the \nfraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that the\ncirculation rate of the books decline with age according to an average \ngeometric pattern of obsolescence..\n   The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is\nutilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decision\nvariable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage \nrate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time that\na book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being \nused.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which \nthe time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence, \nalthough the least-cost selection rule is independent of the composite \ndistribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends upon \nthe circulation activities of the individual libraries..\n   An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected\nfrom three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parameters\nextracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rules\nand the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from\nstorage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the\ncollection must be stored..\n   Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the\nlatter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situation \nwhere the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit \nrelocation cost..\n   Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values\nshow that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively \ninsignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in the \ncapacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results; \nand that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost\ndifferential..

The experiment is a retrieval experiment\nand uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by \nnonrandomly deleting terms from documents..

The results show that the \n"optimal" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few\ndocuments are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more\neffective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents\nare wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for \nthe quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never \nimproves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A\ncorollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same\naverage breadth where one indexing consists of\nsemantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the\nother consists of merely "reasonable" index terms..

Two aspects to be considered in designing a storage\nsystem are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and the \ncriteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This study\ndemonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storage \nquantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the\nsmall shelving costs associated with stored materials..\n   Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and the\nother utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared..\nFor the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost critical\nage at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the \nfraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that the\ncirculation rate of the books decline with age according to an average \ngeometric pattern of obsolescence..\n   The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is\nutilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decision\nvariable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage \nrate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time that\na book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being \nused.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which \nthe time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence, \nalthough the least-cost selection rule is independent of the composite \ndistribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends upon \nthe circulation activities of the individual libraries..\n   An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected\nfrom three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parameters\nextracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rules\nand the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from\nstorage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the\ncollection must be stored..\n   Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the\nlatter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situation \nwhere the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit \nrelocation cost..\n   Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values\nshow that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively \ninsignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in the \ncapacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results; \nand that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost\ndifferential..

The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking,\nbegan gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment\nof many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts\nto use computers for nationwide bibliographic information "utilities."\nThese movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being\ncost-effective, productive ventures.  Inter-institutional cooperation not only\npromises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new\nproblems and demands.  Formalized cooperation among different institutions\nrequires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance\nto a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user\nsubgroups.  It also requires more careful and productive system planning\nand design, including intelligent consideration of the "make versus buy"\nissue.  Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and\nconsiderations.\n  One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth\nin the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated\nby the federal government and those operated by the private sector.  The\napparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same\nproblems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among\nlibrary and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed\nmaterials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less\nrapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs,\nserials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes.  The\ninclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series -\nreflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the\nownership and distribution of information.

In fact, it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set of\nrequirements for sound measurement, rather than on just one or two\nelements of it, which is the quality that sets this book apart from any\nprevious report in the area of job satisfaction.\n    Not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for both\nacademicians and practitioners.

Thus the program\nnow corresponds to a general process for comprehending\nlanguage, and it provides a methodology for adding the\nadditional information this process requires to actually\ncomprehend text of any particular kind.\n  The memory structure and comprehension process of TLC\nallow new factual assertions and capabilities for relating\ntext to such stored assertions and capabilities for relating\ntext to such stored assertions to generalize automatically.\nThat is, once such an assertion or capability is put into the\nsystem, it becomes available to help comprehend a great many\nother sentences in the future.\n', 'file_334.txt': "        Librarians are known for their organizational work\nwith recorded knowledge.
